Peter's meeting notes:
	
	Merge Conflicts:
	What is a Conflict: When line-by line two branches are brought together and git cannot find a common parent and/or cannot find a way to combine them
		After you merge in a pull-request or any merge that cannot successfully combine, git will show you what cannot combine through vscode or any editor
		
		To solve these:
		 Git or VSCODE will show you the conflicting code in show changes
			!! warning, the 'show changes' button doesn't give you editable files, you still have to edit the file you made with both versions in file seperated by a '========'
			
			!! Above the '====' is the Current Changes, Below it is the Incoming Changes!!
			If some code is incorrect: just delete the red code in Incoming Changes file or >>>>> <branch name> that is incorrect
			If you want to add both to current file: copy everything into the Current Changes file or  >>>>>HEAD file it opened 
				Both of these have their own buttons in VSCODE!
			What is Current Changes or <<<<HHEAD?
				under this line, shows the local changes
			What is Incoming Changes or >>>>> <branch_name>?
				the version on github that is merging
		
	In-Class-Example:
		Conflict.sh was sent to main slack, designed to be ran through linux/mac terminal and force a git conflict using git commands
		Creates shakespear git and tries ot make two changes at once if it fails, is saved as all versions, flagged as a conflict
			You can then select what you want in 
	
	What causes conflicts?
		When conflicting, two changes cannot be added together, GIT will show the two+ versions trying to be combined that do not agree
	
		Can be caused by:
			editing a branch at the same time
			merging branches that are far away from eachother (no parent to compare)
			
	Where to run git stuff:
		Always work in directory/folder you are merging on the vs!!
	
	Git log: produces a log of all commits/ merges that happened to check on status

	Merge Tool: A utility that opens up an editor for each file and select what you want, VSCODE can do this if you ask luke!!
