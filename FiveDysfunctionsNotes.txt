    Personal friends with chairman that appointed her. She is seen as a cultural outlier and met with controversy for commanding a culture she isn't a part of.

        Jeff        Former CEO, network guru but fails to properly manage. His meetings are bland and lifeless without a care about progress. He creates micromanaged agendas, minutes and documents of 
        meetings but fails to produce any results.

        Mikey       Marketing, a brand-building titan with a pedigree. Socially clueless and complains openly about disagreement with her choices. Often causes unneeded drama.

        Martin      Chief technologist, a professional inventor that created original specifications with many accolades. Fails to care about participation and is often distracted. Snarky toward any ignorance and learning.

        JK          Another Jeff, but initialized for less confusion. Sales, more seasoned and older than most staff. Very honest and transparent but is non-committal and flakey. Used to be punctual.

        Carlos      Customer support, position is only for when company grows. Quiet listener, downplays successes, very bored but no issues.

        Jan         Chief Financial Officer, Devil in the details person, miserly as her position should be and prideful about her work. She is not much of a problem.

        Nick        Chief Operating Officer, Most accolades. Forced himself into position as bargaining chip. Wanted to shine, but duties ground to a halt when company plummeted. Not vocal but airs superiority on others.

Kathryn proceeded to make the company uneasy by researching and observing how the staff interacted on the daily, as well as suggesting a sabbatical for all workers to restart things.
