The scrum guide:

Scrum   Framework for developing, delivering and sustaining complex products
            made in early 1990's
Usages  Originally meant to manage developed products, but can be for:
            R+D of markets
            Developing products
            Frequent re-releases
            Cloud maintenance and Development
            Renewing products
Theory  Built on process control theory or Empiricism:
            Knowledge is from experience and decisions on known information.
                To control risk, Scrum incrementally controls development.
3 Pillars   Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
