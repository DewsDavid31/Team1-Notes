These are some notes from research in git and messing around


Using git:

git add <file or directory wanted>
    In visual studio: >Git: Stage (when file is opened)
        for staging all changes:
            In visual studio >Git: Stage All changes
            In Bash: git add -a
    temporarily holds the files currently looked at by editor or near ls of terminal


git commit -m ""
    In Visual Studio: >Git: Commit
    prepares updates to file for repo upload and can notify the github site of this it appears

git push
    In visual studio: >Git: Push
    Appears to apply changes to repo on website if able, sometimes an argument of the repo used is required in command line
    Can sometimes need the remote url if connection not established it seems

git pull <url>
    In Visual Studio: >Git: Pull
        Visual studio appears to assume current file is pulled to
    Appears to merge from remote to current ls location

git fetch <url>
    In Visual Studio: >Git: fetch
        In VS temporarily opens current version of file
        In command line, appears to produce a copy of the current file pulled at ls location or specified path
