Headfirst design patterns ch1: Intro to design patterns
    Usage and benefits of patterns found by wisdom of past coders

The duck problem    A method called fly() on a duck pond simulation program is inherited to all Duck subclasses
                        Sadly, causes most fake ducks to fly as well, as well as not making code easy to maintain and fix
                        Could be overriden but would require updating the Duck class for each subclass forever

Problem with inheritance    Code is duplicated but adjusting at runtime is difficult and unintended behavior can be added to subclasses

Interface Solution  a Flyable interface is made calling its own fly() methods could avoid duplication, but needs constant tweaking

Encapsulation Principle     "Identify aspects of you app that can vary and seperate them from what stays the same"
                                In most cases of maintenance, we want to be able to remove and replace changing patterns        
                                    Basis of all design patterns
Interface Principle         "Program to an interface, not an implementation"
                                Changing parts should be made into an interface or abstract interface for established
                                    This allows methods called by interface to be decided on runtime for flexibility
                                    ex: dog a= new dog(); becomes Animal a = new Dog(); or Animal a = getAnimal();
                                            a.makeSound();
    Pros:   Allows other classes to reuse set of behaviors, can be applied at any part of the dev cycle

How to integrate behavior   1) Add instance variables to main class that are interface in types
                            2) Each class polymorphically points to specified swappable behavior
                            3) Implement interface- main class calls offloaded method on runtime
                            4) Subclasses intitialize with given behaviors
                            5) Apply set behavior in setter and getter for on-runtime swapping/adjusting

Composition Principle   "Favor composition over inheritance"
                            Encapsulated features are generally more flexible than superclassing and allow runtime swapping

Strategy patterns   Family of algorithmns that encapsulate a set of behaviors for interchangability
                        Most useful for independent changes and preferences from users

Chapter 2 headfirst design patterns: Observer pattern

Example     A weather station needing to update a bunch of display devices on current forecast

Problem     We want to maintain a link with an assortment of devices and display types without wasting code

Main pattern    We encapsulate a Publisher and Subscriber model, called Subject and Observer in our cases

Observers       Can subscribe or unsubscribe to updates by registering or deregistering with Subject

The pieces involved     Need a ConcreteSubject class pointing to a Subject interface that can call or be called by an Observer interface pointed by a concreteObserver object
                            This is done such that the data, and behaviors of each piece are easily changable like pattern 1
Pros        Cleaner sharing of same data
Cons        Can be counterintuititve in certain implementations

Loose Coupling  Interaction with little publicity to each other piece
                    Code reuse is indepenedent from Observer and Subject sides

Loose Coupling Principle    "Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact!"
                                Allows objects to interact more flexibly

The general paradigm
                        Subject object deals with nitty gritty setters and getters, Subject then uses interface to call notify when changes occur in getters and setters
                        Said notify either calls observer interface's update method, injecting new data or has observer inteface call getters and setters on sent instance 
                        of Subject from Subject itself to later work with given information in actual concreteObserver as it wishes.

Subject interface   
                        registerObserver - takes observer as argument to add to arraylist usually
                        removeObserver - removes observer from arrayList to no longer be notified
                        notifyObserver - sends reference of itself and data object usually, null if nothing changed
Observer interface      
                        update - called using arguments specified by api to be states/data that currently changed in Subject

displayElement
                        The concreteObserver usually, could do anything since Subject doesn't know or creates

Push               When the Subject is set such that data is injected into observer class
Pull                When a Subject is set such that observers get data from passed instance of Subject

Java's supported    Has built-in libraries for Observable type and Observer classes 
                        Allows both push and pull as well as custom settings for when updates occur
How to change updates      notify will never be called unless setChanged() is called first, allowing programmers to specify when data should be pushed or pulled

Issues in Usage     Observable cannot be trusted to produce data in a specific order upon pull or push
                     Observer is a class not an interface in java supported libraries, not flexible in implememntation
                        setChanged() cannot be sub-classed

Head-first patterns Ch 3 Decorator pattern:
    Example         A coffee shop is struggling to update its massive menu with changing costs and build-your-own format of beverages

    Original setup  Superclass of Beverage, subclassing each possible combination and each beverage has a cost method   
                        An attrocity, could cause millions upon millions of classes and cost adjustments cannot be easily applied!

    Open-Closed Principle   "Classes should be open for extension, but closed to modification"
        Allows stability, but flexible usage of code
            Comes at the price of complexity!!

    Decorator big-picture   Base object is wrapped in added object wrapped in added object and so on. To call methods, call outside wrapper, which calls inside wrapper etc. etc.
        Lends itself to recursion in my mind
        Requires each wrapper to be the same type as its enwrapped object!!!
            Because it is the same type, the entire pile of wrappers can be passed around as one single object of its type!!

    implementation  Components, or base objects are made with interfaces
                        concreteComponent uses and interface of Component to then be wrapped in Decorator interface that is used by the concreteDecorator class
                            All parts must have the same recursive function, but concreteDecorator can have as many methods as it wishes!
    Drawbacks   Fails to function properly on component-only calculations such as end-of-sale discounts because then each layer would have to know previous layers
                Order cannot be guaranteed without other patterns!!
                Can produce an insane amount of small instances and may require extensive libraries with counterintutive combinations!!

    Java.IO     Uses this pattern extensively with components being InputStreams and wrappers being BufferedReader and other readers

Headfirst CH 4 The factory pattern
    Instantiation:      Can be very messy, if we need to instantiate a class that could be anything, a large set of if statements and constructors must be made
The problem with New:   Although it is necessary in languages like Java, it can lead to complications on being dynamic at runtime

Our problem:    We own a pizza parlor with a class pizzaOrder to be constructed, but different types of pizza require a String argument with a switch statement in construction
    This sounds ok, until revisions of the menu become a mountain of new, sometimes-overlapping, pizza types
    
Factories:      We encapsulate construction in another class, called a factory that calls construction on its own and returns a wanted object of other class at runtime
                    Our Pizza class begins with its own factory in its members!

                    This is still not the actual pattern but related!!!
The bigger issue:   Upon releasing this new factory-based class, other companies and services started to use it customly, even when constructed customly for each client
                        Abstraction:    We can replace the factory class code back into the original pizzaStore class, but make the pizzaStore factory into an abstract method within
                                Then we can subclass to each client type!
                                    Now each subclass can define their createPizza() to the abstract method to make an interface of sorts

Big Picture:    The Factory pattern
    Encapsulation of object creation
        A Creator class extend subclass creator classes that pick a concrete product to instantiate from the concreteProducts that interface the abstract product
            Creator doesn't decide the product since it has no connection to products at all!
                !! Each subclass only has one dependency while non-factory has N dependencies to 1!!
                
Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes"
    Instead of many classed depending upon parents, both parents and children depend on middle abstract class
     1) create abstract product class for creator
     2) subclass abstract class to product options
     3) let creator(s) call abstraction as interface
     4) let static factories in abstraction grab needed concrete product

     Guidelines: Not mandatory, but good to follow
        1) No variable should reference concrete class
        2) No class should be from concrete class
        3) No method should override method of its base classes
Problem of ingredients: what if each sub-store needs different ingredients for pizza?
    Needs their own set of factories
        Make an interface for possible components types
        Build subclasses that implement the interface for each region
        Implements set of ingredients to be used with factory
        attach calls from pizza store code

Factory process:
    Abstract Factory provides an interface for possible products
    Local Factory provides implementations for products
    Store class as template for concrete factory output
    Concrete store calls local factory class to instantiate resources and combine resources on runtime
    All return a product decided upon runtime by local scope and identification
Formal Definition: Defines an interface for making families of related/dependent objects without specifying concrete classes
    Client class- made with specs of abstract factory and calls abstract factory interface
    Abstract factory-interface with product creation methods
    Concrete Factory- child of abstract factory that calls abstract
    Abstract Product- interface of product and its creation methods
    Concrete Product- The locally defined product option implementing abstract product

    Client is decoupled from specifics of dependencies
    Allows swapping of possible products while the factory only cares about methods and resources to make a product
        Method vs abstract: Method is used for making one product, while entire pattern is used for a family of products

Headfirst Design ch6 Singleton pattern
    Why not just global?: Global variable will require to be created if in an object, may prove to be intensive

    public MyClass {
        private MyClass()
    }
    ^^ This creates a situation of scope where only the class itself can call its own constructor
            But to call it, you must use a static factory method like
                public static MyClass getInstance(){
                    return new MyClass();
                }

        To make the factory method ensure singleton, we add a reference that always returns the wanted object, unless it is null, it creates one
        if(instance == null){
           instance =  getInstance();
        }
        return instance;

    Our problem: We command a chocolate boiler intended to combine milk and chocolate for chocolate bars
        We can accidentally fill a full boiler or empty a full one!
            seems fine because isBoiled an isFull are checked before
                !! But other classes instantiating it can cause undefined behavior!

    Formal Definition: Ensures a class has only one instance and providing global access to it
        Singleton class- has a static unique instance member and a static factory method that calls a private constructor, while checking for Singleton
                !!! other threads can stumble and make their own instances!!!
                    !! To fix this add synchronized to prevent convergent threads on same method!!
                            !! Is computationally expensive, because in-line operations are slow in assembler!!
                            Alternative, if too slow for usage:
                                return a static instance of unique singleton early as a member 
                                    Called eager Instantiation
                                    factory just returns member!!
                                        !! This works because JVM reaches instance creation before threading!!
                            Another alternative, use double-check locking to reduce synchronization
                                Check if instance exists, then check again inside the synchronization
                                    Needs to add volatile to instance above in member
                                        allows multithreading at beginning for speed
                            
Heads up design patterns ch 6

The command pattern - Encapsulation of Method invocations
	Doesn't worry about implementation of methods, instead reuses crystallized methods

	Our problem: A remote control is given with seven programmable slots each wish an on/off button and a global undo button
			Many different vendors made programs for the remote and the manufacturers want an api for programming the remote such that each slot can be assigned control of a device(s)

		Contains a whole array of interfacing classes for all sorts of appliances
			Some methods are non-boolean and could be anything!!
	Big Picture:
		Have a requester that requests to an object without knowing any details about the request's handling
			Command object - created on request side, implementing the 'do work' method which does 'something' the requester doesn't know what
	
	An example: The diner!
		Customer gives waitress an order, waitress places order on counter, cook preps meal
		Order slip - The request, has an interface of only one method, orderUp()
		Cook- has the knowledge and work to do, implements all methods implied in implemented orderUp(), details are inside request

	How it works:
		Client object makes a command object
		Command object provides one method: execute
		Client calls setCommand() on an invoker objects where it gets stored
		Invoker at some point calls the command objects execute()
		Execute invokes actions in reciever
	In Details:
		Reciever is exposed to only one method, execute()!
			No other object knows what execute does, nor cares
			Can rapid-fire instantiate many disparate and constantyl changing orders/methods at once!
		

		Diagram:
		
			Client -> Reciever <- Concrete Command -> Command interface <- Invoker
			Client -> Concrete Command
				In essence, wrapping up a bunch of call parameters and interfacing the commanded objects to do the bidding.
					
	The command pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object letting you parameterize objects with different requests, queue or log requests and support doable actions!

Macros-  A new command that encompasses many other commands in one command object, allowing multiple calls to happen at once.
	A macro class can be made of an array of commands that can be given as arguments to use in chain of command pattern!
Queueing Requests - Macro sets can be used to persist a chain of requests even after program is complete, or even in another thread. A job queue is based on this. Allows a flexibility for requests to be of any kind without Invoker and Command being coupled at all!

Logging requests- Crash recovery is important, to recover, a list of past methods/requests can allow accurate recovery.	
		Command Pattern can use load() and store() as implemented commands
			Serialization native to java can help this with some pitfalls!!
			Can save from a last stable checkpoint for expensive persistence
			Invoker of our pattern stores used methods using store()
				upon crash, load is called on invoker
Chapter 7 Adapter and Facade Patterns

	Adapter- Take a current inteface and enwrap it to fit the new responsibility
	How the pattern works:
		1) Client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it and using target's interface(Adapter's inteface)
		2) Adapter transaltes the requested call into 1+ calls on adaptee using adaptee interface
		3) Client recieves results not unfamiliar to usual request

	Strict definition:
		Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This allows classes to work together that normally could not due to incompatible interfaces.
	
	What it looks like:
		CLient calls Target interface of adapter, Adapter handles request by calling request() towarrd adaptee interface, the adaptee handles a custom set of methods to produce a set of results equivalent, returns up the chain...
	
	Object vs Class adapters:
		Class adapters use multiple inheritance(not possible in java), dapater interface then inherits Target and Adaptee so it can reach into both.
	Pros: Object can adapt to any subclass
	      Object uses more composition
	      Class can override behavior
	      Class doesn't need to reimplement entire classes
	      Class can handle rapid changing classes

	Cons: Class has to be specific to a class only
	      Object can't easily handle changing sub-classess

	Real-world examples:
		Old-world enumerators: Java used to run entirely off of enumerations(stepping through collections by calling nextElement() without knowledge of order)
		New-world iterators: Today java is moving toward Iterable(), with asking for hasNext() next() and remove() where next elements act like a stack.
		
		To fix these, we interface from enumerable to iterable by removing / adding calls through the adapter interface! Usually called EnumertaionIterator
		!!Removed functionality like remove() can lead to exceptions upon calling, so developers be careful and document hard!!

	Decorator vs Adapter: Adapter is usually a specific kind of decorator when using composition that calls between disparate types while a decorator deals with compatible types usually changing responsibility. Facde makes interface simpler.


	Facade Pattern - Takes a complex subsystem and makes it easier by implementing a set of interfaces into one macro
	Definition: Facade pattern provides a unified interface for a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

principle of least knowlegde - Reduce the amount of interactions between actions to a few 'close friends' or 'Talk only to your immediate friends'

How to keep 'friend' objects low:
	only invoke from: the object itself, objects passes as args, any object that makes this object, any components of an object

	Principle forces asking objects to make requests for us

Chapter 8 Template method pattern:
	Template method: a method serves as an abstract template for an algorithmn where individual methods and pieces can be delegated to be changed on run-time by other interfaces/subclasses

	Prevents duplication of methods, allows protection of information by decoupling methods, changes can be made easily piece-meal. Algorithmn is in one place! 
	Definition: Defines a skeleton of an algorithmn in a  method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method allows subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the structure.

	Hooks- defaulted methods that can be offloaded/ignored from template between other libraries/classes
	
	How to use hooks- write method wanted to override, and it shall be done/ignored based on template class

	Hollywood principle - "don't call use we will call you"
		Prevents 'depencency rot' where high-level pieces and low-level components cause an unstable web of dependency
			Leads to poor readability and testing/modification
			Low level pieces hook themselves in to be called,causing dependency to only flow one direction
		How it relates to template?
			Template forces a Hollywood Principle, it calls delegated lower classes, not the other way

	Real-world: The basis for frameworks, Java sort method delegates sort method by doing this

Chapter 9 Iterator and Composite patterns
	Keeping collections without exposing code
	
	Our problem:
		A merger happened between two diner libraries, one implemented ArrayList, the other Array with specific dependencies
		We want a menu for both, but both are incompatible except for main menu display
	
		We have a waitress object that can print menus and fetch if they are vegetarian
			But each menu needs specific loops to iterate through the menu items!!
				Adding diners, would be costly in looping!!
	Solution: We create an object called an interator that will pass through any collection of objects using an interface!
	
	The iterator pattern - Relies on an interface called iterator that can call hasNext() and next() in order to scan through a collection of any kind
		Calls Concrete iterator that handles a kind of collection if hook is needed
		!! eliminate getters for menu items will expose code in original collections!!
		!! Add iterator factory in menu!!
		waiter/client class can then call factories of iterators of collections, and use them to step through items
		
	To make our example cleaner: use java.util.Iterator interface, ArrayList already implements iterate(), but array has no support, so we have to make it implemented
	!! remove() is extended, so remove has to be crafted for array!!
	Now the menu interface is responsible for populating the menu while iterator handles arraylist and dinermenuiterator adapts to iterator


	Strict definition: provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.

	Single Responsibility principle- A class should only have one reason to change
		Allow only one way a class can change(one responsibility) two + responsibilities changes too often in order to decouple
			Cohesion- measurement if a module supports a single purpose/responsiblity
				In our example, we remove getItems() and instead apply to CafeMenu interface for more cohesion
	Our new issue: if we add another menu each time, it becomes obtuse for the waiter/ess class, an approach would be to add a container for each menu
		We really need an easily traversable tree

	The Composite pattern: Allows to compose objects into tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.


	A menu tree, that itself can be used as a menu itself
		Such as applying a print accross the whole thing
		
	The structure
		A client calls component class
			Component class depends on leaf and composite classes, leaves do ops()
			while composites add, remove components and do ops as well as fetching children
			!!leaves have no children!!
			
				In our example: client is waitress, component is menuComponent, menuitem is a leaf, menu is considered a child component
			menu component cannot use getters, but interfaces them
				throw exceptions
			menu items, implement all getters and print
			menus implement some getters, add/remove and print
			print needs iterator to work properly
				!!Trades cohesion for uniform transparent calls!!
	Composite iterator- Very strict iterator, ensures that iteration is don and all children are included in iteration
				 next method checks item on, if it has next, applies it to iterable stack along with its members, recursively calling each child
				hasNext checks stack if empty, otherwise pops
			!!So difficult because it is iterating externally!!
			
	Null iterator- If a read item has no iteration possible
		There are two approaches:
			1) return a null
				Requires heavy-lifting outside iteration, for checking empty == null
			2) return an iterator that always throws false
				Best practice, shows iterator is stuck and done
					Next returns a null, hasNext returns false, remove throws exceptions
	Iterator and Composite combined: Allow a tree traversal with recursive efficiency on all items of similar family


Chapter 10: State Pattern

	Our problem: We are working on a gumbball machine, converted and gutted to use a cpu to function and collect data
	We are given a state machine diagram on how it should function
		!! Actually called a state diagram!!
	State machines 101:
		1) define all states possible
		2) create instance variable to hold current state
		3) define values for each state(an enum might be good)
		4) define all possible actions that happen to system
		5) Create a class that can use conditional statements to find what methods are accessible in each state
	This works great with conditional code, but gets hair on implementation, of new features so we encapsulate the states and methods into a state interface
		To fix this we instead replace each state with an extension of the state class to be refrenced, that way we can add neew behavior easilty	


Ch 11 Notes: The Proxy Pattern

    Our problem: the gumball company wants a monitoring system to report state and inventory of gumballs

    Our first solution:
        Add location field and getLocation method to gumball machine
        Add getters for inventory and a Gumball monitor class to report from composed machine
        !! But it fails to actually monitor a gumball remotely!!
    The Remotes Proxy: An object that acts as a local representative of a remote object
        Remote Object- an object in the heap of another JVM

    Java Remote Method Invokation
        Provides a bridge to remote methods 
    Remote methods 101:
        A client object needs to call a client helper in otder to notify the service helper and then the service object
            The client helper facade's as the service itself
                In order to bridge the gap, the client helper must chuck the method and its args through a socket connection
                Service helper unpacks the socket data and calls the method provided
                Service object returns output, which gets packed and sent back by service helper
    How the JAVA RMI does it:
        RMI factorizes and builds helper objects for you:
            Called the RMI STUB(client) and RMI SKELETON(service)
            Includes socket networking, discovery, everything
            !! ADD TRY/CATCH ON CALLS, CAN FAIL!!
    How to use RMI:
        1) Make remote interface - all remote calls
        2) Make remote implementation - Actual remote device methods
        3) Generate Stubs and Skeletons using RMIC on BASH
        4) call rmiregistry on BASH to register client and service handshake
        5) run RMI code once to instantiate

    Remote interface:
        1) extends Remote, no methods but acts as marker for RMI to use
        2) Make all method calls throw RemoteException
        3) !! MUST BE SERIALIZABLE!!
    Remote implementation:
        1) implement remote interface class
        2) extend UnicastRemoteObject to work on RMI
        3) make public blank constructor throwing RemoteException, allowing a throw in the case of startup failure
        4) Register service using java.rmi.Naming:
            try{
                MyRemote service = new MyRemoteImp();
                Naming.rebind("RemoteHello", service);
            } catch(Exception ex){}
    How remote service finds stubs:
        The client gets stub object by doing a lookup call through RMI for the registered name in rmiregistry
        This registry is on the server so it can be invoked remotely
    Our solution: use RMI to help us notify the machine
